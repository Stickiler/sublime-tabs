# sublime-tabs

This enables sublime-style tabs in Atom.

Normally, the Tabs package will open a new tab for each file, and it will stay open even if you don't edit it.

sublime-tabs enables you to click a file through the Tree View on the left, it will open it as a "temp" file like sublime does,
and will close the tab if another tab is opened without you editing it.

## To Use
Install either through the Atom package search, or by:
```sh
$ apm install sublime-tabs
```

This is a replacement for the `Tabs` package.  Open your Settings, and disable the `Tabs` package by searching for it and clicking "Disable"

## Uninstall
This is an early version, so it *may* screw things up.  If it does, you can re-enable `Tabs`, and disable `sublime-tabs`.
